Recaps
------------------------------------

This simple program allows you to switch between languages using the mostly-unused CapsLock key.

Just press CapsLock and the language will change. You can use Alt-CapsLock if you still need the old CapsLock action - to write a lot of text in capital letters.

If you accidentally typed some text in the wrong layout, Ctrl-CapsLock should fix it.

If you have more than two languages installed, you can select the ones you want to cycle through if you right click the application's icon.

Also it improves language switching using Alt-Shift combination: LeftAlt-LeftShift will always switch to the first language installed,
while RightAlt-RightShift will always switch to the second.

Enjoy!
